Hey o/

I'm a computer science student at the University of St. Gallen, where I'm busy learning about CS, math, and finance since 2022.

## When I'm not buried in code...

I'm probably carving down ski slopes or battling it out in Battlefront 2 and Minecraft! I'm also a tech enthusiast and self-host everything from file servers to email – there's something really satisfying about building your own digital ecosystem.

## My journey so far

In April 2023, I had the opportunity to participate in Spring Week programmes in London with Bank of America, BNP Paribas, and BP. The following summer, I interned at Bayrische Landesbank in fixed income trading, and more recently at Nomura in Global Markets, where I'll be starting as a graduate analyst in trading come July 2025.

From 2022 to 2024, I wore several hats at the Helvetian Investment Club – Board Member, Head of Events, and Head of IT. I helped launch the ACM@HSG club in 2023 and stayed on as an advisory board member for a year. I've also had the chance to teach as a TA for Prof. Andrei Ciortea's Distributed Systems course.
