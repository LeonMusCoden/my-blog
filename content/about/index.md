# About Me

Hi there,

For as long as I can remember, I've been passionate about computer science, maths, and finance.  
University life at St. Gallen, where I started in September 2022, has only deepened that interest.  
Currently, when I'm not studying, I enjoy skiing and gaming, with Battlefront 2 and PlateUp being favorites.  
Keen on technology, I also love self-hosting various tools, from file sharing to email.

Years 2023 and 2024 were filled with professional experiences like Spring Weeks in London at Bank of America, BNP Paribas, and BP, and internships at Bayrische Landesbank and Nomura.  
On the side, I contributed actively to university clubs, serving as Head of IT and Events for the Helvetian Investment Club and helping to found ACM@HSG.  
Under Prof. Andrei Ciortea, I also worked as a teaching assistant for Distributed Systems, gaining teaching experience.
